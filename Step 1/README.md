# What is python script (program)
  - It is a Text File
  - Name ends with '.py' (file extension)
  - Can be executed using python interpreter

# What is Python Interpreter
  - It is a program (Written in C/C++)
  - Available for Windows, Linux, MacOS, ..
  - It can execute python code (translate into machine code)
  - How to use it ?

# Example: Simple commandline application
  - Hello World (hello-world.py)
  - Add two numbers (sum-two-numbers.py)
  - Give sum of first n triangle numbers (sum-triangle.py)

# Variables

      dict (dictionary)
  - Set of data
      set, frozenset
  - Boolean
      bool
  - Other
  - type() funtion for type check

  - single line comments and multiline comments
  - when and why use comments

# Decision Making in python (Branching)
  - simple if statements
  - if elif else
  - nested if statements

# Membership Operators
    in, not in

# Loops
  What is a loop

# For Loop
  - for loop syntax
  - When to use
  - code block of for loop
